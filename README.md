# Trip-Advisor-Clone
Our Trip Advisor-inspired website is a sleek, user-friendly front-end platform designed to help travelers explore destinations, plan trips, and discover the best experiences worldwide. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website offers an interactive interface that mirrors the functionality and design of popular travel review platforms, without requiring a back-end or database.

The homepage features a visually engaging layout with a prominent search bar, allowing users to look up cities, landmarks, hotels, restaurants, or attractions. Eye-catching banners and curated destination cards showcase trending travel spots and user-rated favorites, giving the site a professional and polished appearance.

Each destination page includes static reviews, images, and ratings to simulate real-world feedback. Visitors can view hotel listings, see star ratings, and browse detailed descriptions, amenities, and nearby attractions. Restaurant and activity pages follow a similar format, providing insight into popular local experiences. Though no real-time data or user submissions are handled, the mock content is presented in a way that makes the experience feel authentic.

Navigation is smooth and intuitive, thanks to a responsive design that works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The site includes a navigation bar, filters for sorting content (e.g., by rating or category), and interactive elements like clickable cards and image sliders‚Äîall powered by JavaScript.

This front-end only travel advisor website is ideal for showcasing UI/UX design skills, building a portfolio, or serving as a foundation for future full-stack development. It demonstrates a strong grasp of layout structuring, responsive design principles, and front-end interactivity, making it both visually appealing and functionally impressive‚Äîeven without server-side functionality.
